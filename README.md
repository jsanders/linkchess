A simple little project to allow people to turn board positions from games of
chess into urls they can send their friends.

Currently supports giving a fen url parameter which represents a board position
in [Forsyth-Edwards Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation)
and simply shows it. I plan to extend this to allow dragging and dropping of pieces to build
a position and generating a shortened url to that position that people can copy and send.

It's super simple to see this working, just download this repository and open index.html in a browser.

Try It!

Fun!
